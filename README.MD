<h1 align="center">Sentinel C2 🚀</h1>

## **1. Command-and-Control (C2) :** 💻

- **🔧 Remote Control :**
  - Full control of compromised systems, whether it's to monitor activities, deploy additional payloads, or execute specific programs.
  - Compatible with various communication protocols to adapt to network configurations.
- **💡 Command Execution :**
  - Launch arbitrary commands directly from the admin console. Perfect for automating malicious tasks or quickly deploying another payload across all infected machines.
  - Command logging for optimal tracking of actions taken.

## **2. DDoS Attacks (Distributed Denial of Service) :** 🌐

- **⚙️ Customizable Options :**
  - Configure the intensity, duration, and type of attack (UDP flood, SYN flood, etc.)
  - Real-time dashboard to track the effectiveness of the attack + Dstat system.
- **💪 Robust Infrastructure :**
  - Using a network of compromised devices to guarantee large-scale, hard-to-counter attacks. With the $25/month plan, you attack only with your own machines. If you upgrade to the $50/month plan, you'll gain access to all the machines infected by the Sentinel C2 team and its numerous users.

## **3. Cryptocurrency Mining :** 💰

- **🛠️ Resource Exploitation :**
  - Utilize the CPU and GPU of compromised machines to mine cryptocurrencies like Monero. Automatic optimization to minimize user detection.
  - Earnings tracking through a centralized dashboard.
- **💻 Multi-platform Support :**
  - Compatible with a wide variety of hardware to maximize profits.

## **4. Hosting Resistant Payloads :** 🔒

- **🌍 Use of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) :**
  - Payloads are stored on decentralized networks, making their deletion virtually impossible.
  - Fast and anonymous distribution of payloads via a resilient network.
- **🔄 Automated Updates :**
  - Payloads can be modified and updated without direct intervention from the end user (Auto Progress Mode - On).

## **5. Multi-platform Compatibility** 🌏

- **💻 Supported Systems :**
  - Works perfectly on **Windows**, **Linux**, and also through **Python** scripts.
- **🔧 Easy Integration:**
  - Tools can be configured to run autonomously with Auto Progress Mode - On.

## **6. Easy Access and Use :** 🖱️

- **📊 Intuitive Interface :**
  - A clear and user-friendly dashboard that allows you to launch operations with just a few clicks.
  - Support for custom scripts for advanced users.
- **🛠️ Technical Support Included:**
  - Assistance via encrypted channels to resolve issues quickly or get advice promptly.

## **7. Enhanced Anonymity :** 🕵️‍♂️

- **🛡️ User Protection:**
  - Use of proxies, VPNs, and decentralized networks.
  - No personal information stored on the platform's servers.
- **🔐 Persistence:**
  - Advanced mechanisms for self-obfuscation and metamorphism. (Coming soon)

## **8. Automated Propagation and Advanced Exploitation** 🚀

- **🔍 Automated Port Scanning :**
  - Quickly identify exploitable entry points on entire networks. The system detects open ports and vulnerable services in seconds. (Coming soon)
- **⚠️ Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (CVE) :**
  - Updated CVE database to automate the exploitation of already known vulnerabilities (privilege escalation, etc.). (Coming soon)
  - Compatible with frameworks like Metasploit for extended exploitation. (Coming soon)
- **🐛 Propagation :**
  - Automatic distribution of malicious payloads through vectors like network shares, infected emails, or compromised cloud services. (Coming soon)
  - Works autonomously to maximize propagation without intervention.
